# Garshneblanker

Garshneblanker was a screen saver I wrote for the Amiga, starting back
in about 1992, but not really gaining widespread use until the 3.x
series was released some time in 1993.

All my good habits in programming had their origin in writing, and
rewriting (and re-rewriting) Garshneblanker.

This source is excavated from my Amiga 3000, and is thus slightly newer than
the latest public release (v38.8). Alas, I had not been using RCS on the code,
so I could not obtain a more fine grained history of changes.
