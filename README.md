= Garshneblanker

Garshneblanker was a screen saver I wrote for the Amiga, starting back
in about 1992, but not really gaining widespread use until the 3.x
series was released some time in 1993.

All my good habits in programming had their origin in writing, and
rewriting (and re-rewriting) Garshneblanker.

The source here is from the last public release, though if my
forthcoming Amiga 3000 data excavation project is successful, I'll
soon have a full source code history (migrated from RCS no less).
