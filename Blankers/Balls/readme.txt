	Bouncing Balls Blanker   V38.1  (12.2.95)

		by Stefano Reksten and Andrew Richards


	Based on Stefano Reksten Bouncing Balls module v1.2 for
      his BServer screen blanker. Ported and modified by Andrew
      Richards.


	I added the section of code to keep the balls bouncing, when the
velocities of all the balls are below a certain level (2).
	There are problems with the balls "sticking" together, and also problems
with certain collisions not working correctly.
